## Document Organization Rationale

The documentation is split across multiple files to:
- **Improve readability**: Large sections are easier to navigate when separated
- **Enable modular updates**: Individual sections can be updated without affecting others
- **Facilitate Word document conversion**: Each file can be converted separately and combined
- **Enhance performance**: Smaller files load and process faster
- **Support different use cases**: Users can access specific sections without loading entire document

## Conversion to Word Document

To convert this documentation to a Word document:

1. Open each text file in order (1-13)
2. Copy content to Word document maintaining section headers
3. Format flow charts and block diagrams using Word's drawing tools
4. Format code blocks with appropriate monospace font
5. Create clickable table of contents
6. Add page numbers and formatting
7. Insert diagrams as images or use Word's SmartArt for block diagrams
